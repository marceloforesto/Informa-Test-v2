# Informa-Test-v2
Test of the position of developer at Informa Solutions

In this new version, the goal was to improve the previous project, applying more interesting concepts such as: clean Architecture, Dependency Injection, EF Core, repoistory pattern and Reactive Forms with Angular. Some adjustments were made in the database, as well as the use of SQL Lite instead of SQL Server, as used before. Some adjustments needed to be made to refine the project, such as the use of NGXS, as was proposed.


##  Used
- Angular
- .Net Core API
- SQL Lite
